Usage

To customize the PDF output, you can use the following settings in your Pelican configuration file:

	PDF_STYLE_PATH = ""

`PDF_STYLE_PATH` defines a new path where *rst2pdf* will look for style sheets, while `PDF_STYLE` specifies the style you want to use.
For a description of the available styles, please read the [rst2pdf documentation](https://rst2pdf.org/static/manual.html#styles).
